TODO:
- Set up entities & repositories for the different tables in the backend(for the ones other than customer). Every table gets an entity, a repository, and possibly a controller. Then, in the controller, expose whatever APIs need to be exposed
 - fix the missingpathvariable error with the PaymentInformationController

- research the 'one to many' and 'many to one' and 'many to many' relationships annotations in JPA

- 3 things that need to work:
    - Shop (no login required)
    - Login
    - Make Purchases

- Shop
    - pull all products from backend. Then display them on the site

- Login
    - create login portal
    - research how to do authentication in spring(OAUTH2 probably)
    - store login information(username, password hash, payment info, etc...)
    - research what a bean is

- Make Purchase
    - payment processor
    - generate a receipt
    - decrement stock in backend
    - send receipt to user
    - display receipt/purchasing information to user


- Build the front end
